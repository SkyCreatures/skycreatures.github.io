## Autonomous navigation, mapping & earth analytics

At **SkyCreatures**, we specialize in building advanced systems for **autonomous navigation, terrain mapping**, and **earth analytics** — enabling unmanned platforms to move, analyze, and adapt intelligently in the physical world.


### Autonomous Navigation

We develop AI-driven navigation algorithms for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles that allow:

* **GPS-denied navigation** using visual and inertial odometry
* **Real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance**
* **Terrain-aware routing** using onboard sensors and maps
* Integration with **SLAM**, **Kalman filters**, and sensor fusion
* Support for **MavLink**, **ArduPilot**, and other open-source autopilot stacks

Our navigation stack is built for **military-grade environments**, where reliability, speed, and autonomy are essential — whether it's urban warfare, forested zones, or unstructured landscapes.


### 🗺️ Topological mapping & 3D reconstruction

We create solutions for generating **real-time 2D/3D maps** of operational environments from drone-mounted sensors:

* **Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**
* **Stereo vision and depth sensing** for surface modeling
* **LIDAR & radar integration**
* Generation of **topological graphs** for route optimization and mission planning
* Exporting maps in GIS-compatible formats for further analysis

These systems are essential for **mission intelligence, route planning**, and **collaborative drone swarming**.


### Earth observation and analytics

We apply **AI and computer vision** to process aerial imagery and extract actionable terrain and target information:

* **Change detection** (before/after strike analysis, infrastructure loss)
* **Terrain classification** (roads, water bodies, foliage, buildings)
* **Target heatmapping** and anomaly detection
* **Thermal and spectral image processing**
* Integration with **satellite and drone-captured data**
* Compatibility with **edge inference** on Jetson Nano, RK3588, or other NPUs

These analytics support **military decision-making, reconnaissance,** and **real-time battlefield awareness**.

## Built to operate — anywhere

Our mapping and analytics solutions are optimized for deployment on:

* **Raspberry Pi**
* **Orange Pi 5**
* **Jetson Nano & Xavier**
* **Rockchip-based systems (e.g., RK1808, RK3588, RK3576)**

With support for formats like **ONNX**, **RKNN**, and **TensorFlow Lite**, we ensure models run efficiently on lightweight, power-limited platforms with or without internet access.


> **SkyCreatures brings eyes, memory, and intelligence to autonomous systems — so they can navigate, map, and understand the world on their own.**
