## Core technologies we use

We harness a wide range of modern AI/ML technologies, optimized for both performance and deployment flexibility:

### **ML Frameworks and formats**

* **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **TensorFlow Lite**
* **ONNX**, **RKNN Toolkit** for Rockchip NPUs

### **Computer Vision**

* **OpenCV**, **YOLOv5**, **YOLOv8**, **MobileNet-SSD**
* Custom model training for aerial and thermal imagery
* Real-time multi-object tracking and classification

### **Machine learning techniques**

* **CNNs**, **RNNs**, **SVMs**, **Q-Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**
* **Kalman Filtering**, **SLAM**
* **SGD and Adam Optimizers**
* **Data processing** with **Pandas**, **SciPy**

## Embedded & edge optimization

We build solutions that are tailored for lightweight and energy-efficient edge devices:

* **Raspberry Pi**
* **Orange Pi 5**
* **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**
* **Rockchip SoCs** (RK1808, RK3588, RK3576)
* NPUs and accelerators with **CUDA**, **OpenCL**, **RKNPU**

We optimize models for:

* **Real-time performance**
* **Low-power operation**
* **Compact memory footprint**

## Integration with drone ecosystems

SkyCreatures engineers specialize in integrating AI with **drone flight control systems**, ensuring a seamless interface between autonomous decision-making and physical flight behavior.

### We support:

* **MavLink protocol**
* **ArduPilot stack**
* Real-time telemetry feedback
* Autonomous waypoint navigation
* Visual obstacle avoidance
* Smart flight behavior driven by AI inference


## Development languages & environments

We support development in:

* **Python** – for rapid prototyping, training, and edge inference
* **C++** – for high-performance deployments and embedded systems

Our solutions are adaptable across a wide range of **hardware architectures** and are containerized or modularized for easy deployment, update, and scalability.
